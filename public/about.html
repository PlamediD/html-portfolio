    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello, I'm Plamedi, a recent computer science graduate actively seeking my first full-time role in the tech industry, focusing on software engineering, DevOps, or software development.
        <br>I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from Seattle University and an A.A.S. from Bellevue College.</p>

    <p>I am proficient in languages such as C#, C++, Java, Python, and more. I led a team in developing a sophisticated Trip Planner using Flutter, Firebase, and Dart.
        <br>Additionally, I independently designed a minimalist Flutter calculator, showcasing my skills in Dart and Android Studio.
        You can view all my projects on <a href="https://github.com/PlamediD">GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <p>In my internship at Mari's Place for the Arts, I streamlined data collection with a web scraping tool, reducing donor search time by 60%.
        <br>As a teaching assistant at Seattle University, I ensured alignment with Object-Oriented Design principles.
        <br>With experience in data entry at ABC Legal, I achieved an 80% document accuracy rate.</p>

    <p>
    I bring a strong foundation in agile methodologies, cross-team collaboration, and problem-solving, ready to contribute to a dynamic team. Eager to apply my skills and learn in a professional setting, I appreciate your consideration and look forward to contributing to your team's success.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Fun fact: My first name is French, and I always enjoy hearing new pronunciations. If you find it challenging, I'm happy to help. French is my first language, even though I'm not from France.
